# Trello Clone App
This is a simple implementation of Trello

## Running

### `npm install`
Install all dependencies

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage
* Initially you need to create a separate board (Jira)
* Then you need to create statuses for a certain board (Created, In Progress, Done etc.)
* After that, it's possible to create cards for each status
* Created cards may be easily drag-n-dropped from one status to another

## Future Improvements
* Card text update
* Add users on Board
* Add comments from a user
* Add list of tasks to each card
    * After all tasks in the card are completed â€” automatically send card to 'Done' status
